Documentation and blog for the official [yalibs](https://yalibs.dk) site.

**yalibs** is a collection of simple libraries that provide "yet another" implementation of common use cases. 
Each library is completely isolated and must not depend on any other yalibs library, or any other third party library (language standard libraries are allowed).
Our mission is to provide simple, easy to use, open source and easy to understand, [do-one-thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) libraries to anyone who might want and/or need it.

At the time of writing, we only provide libraries for C/C++, but we have plans to extend to more languages such as Java, C# and JavaScript. We endeavor to only use one packaging format and distribution method per language.

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.
