# Introduction

**yalibs** is a collection of simple libraries that provide "yet another" implementation of common use cases. 
Each library is completely isolated and must not depend on any other yalibs library, or any other third party library (language standard libraries are allowed).
Our mission is to provide simple, easy to use, open source and easy to understand, [do-one-thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) libraries to anyone who might want and/or need it.

At the time of writing, we only provide libraries for C/C++, but we have plans to extend to more languages such as Java, C# and JavaScript. We endeavor to only use one packaging format and distribution method per language.

## Getting Involved 

We are actively looking for more help. Both developers and idea-people!
If you are missing a library we recommend submitting an [issue on the yadocs repository](https://github.com/yalibs/yadocs/issues) any language is allowed and we are very open to ideas.
If you already have an implementation and a git repository and your code is [clean](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/), please submit an [issue](https://github.com/yalibs/yadocs/issues) requesting us to fork your repository. We will invite you as a contributor to that fork as well.
If you are experiencing an issue with a library, please submit an issue on the repository's own issue page detailing your problem.

If you want to submit a blog post to the **yadocs** site, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/yalibs/yadocs/pulls).
If you are considering contributing to **yalibs** we urge you to keep a decent tone and be respectful of others.

## This Site

This website is meant to contain deep documentation of the libraries (note, each documentation page here _should_ also be available on the respective library's git repository), but we also have facilities for a [blog](https://yalibs.dk/blog/) where we might post opinion-pieces if we want.

### Why the .dk TLD?

The original creator [sillydan1](https://github.com/sillydan1) is from Denmark and `.dk` is the danish TLD. Also it is much cheaper than a `.com` domain.
